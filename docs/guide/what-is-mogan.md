GNU TeXmacs is a structured scientific editing platform developed since the late 1990s by [Joris van der Hoeven](http://www.texmacs.org/joris/main/joris.html), a mathematician at CNRS in France. It is designed to write high-quality technical documents using an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical interface, and able to achieve the same level of results as LaTeX. Currently, its primary users are concentrated among university students, primary and secondary school teachers, and researchers in higher education institutions.
