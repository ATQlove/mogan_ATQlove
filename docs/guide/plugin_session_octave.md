# Octave Session Plugin

## Installation
The Octave session plugin relies on the [PDF Image Plugin](plugin_image_pdf.md). Please install Ghostscript according to the documentation first, and then check `Help -> Plugins -> Octave` to ensure that the plotting in the document can be rendered correctly.

## Known Issues
Plotter for Octave 6.x and above does not work on Windows. We recommmend that you should use Octave 5.x if you are using the octave plugin on Windows.

## Documentation: Please refer to `Help -> Plugins -> Octave`
